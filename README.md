# Greenhouse-Gas-Emission-Prediction-Analysis-with-Random-Forest

The project aims at doing predictive analysis of greenhouse gases using Random Forest Algorithm. 
We have taken realtime dataset from https://www.aqi.in/in/dashboard/india/karnataka/bangalore website and have used features such as AQI(target variable), CO,NO2,SO2, Ozone Pollutant levels(PM2.5, PM10) as our independent variables. 
The project uses three models Linear Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest to calculate metrics RMSE, MAE, MSE and analyse which model provided most accuracy in AQI prediction value.
In the end of the projext three graphs are plotted for each model comparing the expected and predicted value of AQI.
Along with tother metrics fearure Selection is also calculated to conclude which features among NO2,SO2,Ozone,CO, temperature and humidity has contributed most in AQI levels.
